## 🆕 Recent Enhancements

The following improvements were recently added during active development:

- **Skyvern Integration**: Edge functions `apply-to-jobs` and `get-run` enable automated job application workflow triggers plus polling of run status (screenshots, recording URL, parsed outputs).
- **Server-Side Enrichment**: `apply-to-jobs` auto-enriches applications with user profile details and a signed resume URL when the client omits them.
- **Run Status Polling Hook**: `useSkyvernRun` React hook for lightweight polling until a workflow run reaches a terminal state.
- **Application UX Upgrades**: Readiness badges (Profile / Resume), disabled state + progress label for Apply button, and retry toast events.
- **Resume Import & Multi-Upload**: Drag & drop and multi-file import (PDF / DOC / TXT / JSON) with automatic favorite assignment for the first resume and optional JSON metadata extraction.
- **Toast Event Bridge**: Event-based toast system lets utilities surface user feedback without prop drilling.

Related docs:
- Job sources, ingestion, LinkedIn/search controls, and secrets: see `docs/job-sources.md`.

> These updates pave the way for richer automation telemetry and faster iteration on application flows.

### Profile Data (Experiences, Education, Skills)

The dashboard Profile page now loads real-time data from three normalized tables:

Tables:
```
public.profile_experiences
public.profile_education
public.profile_skills
```

These were added via migration `20250916_add_profile_collections.sql` under `backend/supabase/migrations/`.

Each table enforces RLS (row level security) and policies limiting access to the authenticated owner (`auth.uid() = user_id`).

#### Realtime Publication
These profile tables and the core `profiles` table are included in the `supabase_realtime` publication so UI updates stream instantly across sessions.

Verify in your database:
```sql
select schemaname, tablename
from pg_publication_tables
where pubname = 'supabase_realtime'
  and tablename in ('profiles','profile_experiences','profile_education','profile_skills')
order by tablename;
```

#### Applying the Migration Locally
```bash
# From repo root
supabase start            # if not already running
supabase db push          # applies new migration files
```

#### Verifying
```sql
select table_name from information_schema.tables 
 where table_schema = 'public' 
   and table_name like 'profile_%';
```

#### Frontend Hook
The React hook `useProfileCollections` (in `src/hooks/useProfileCollections.ts`) provides:
- Loading + error state per collection
- Realtime subscriptions (Postgres changes) filtered by current user
- CRUD helpers: add / update / delete for experiences, education, skills

#### Usage Example
```tsx
import { useProfileCollections } from '@/hooks/useProfileCollections';

function ProfileSection() {
  const { experiences, addExperience } = useProfileCollections();
  if (experiences.loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return (
    <div>
      {experiences.data.map(e => <div key={e.id}>{e.title}</div>)}
      <button onClick={() => addExperience({ title: 'New Role', company: 'Acme', location: 'Remote', start_date: new Date().toISOString(), is_current: true, description: '' })}>Add</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Deployment Notes
After merging these changes, ensure production database has the migration applied either by:
1. Running `supabase db push` against the remote project (with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` & `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` configured), or
2. Manually creating equivalent tables & policies through the Supabase dashboard SQL editor (paste the migration SQL).

Set environment variables in Vercel:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=... # project API URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... # regenerated anon key (rotate if previously exposed)
```

> If the anon key was exposed publicly, rotate it in Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API → Regenerate anon key, then update Vercel & redeploy.

#### Pushing Migrations to a Remote Supabase Project
From the repo root:

```bash
# Authenticate once
supabase login

# Link this folder to your remote project
export SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=your-project-ref   # e.g. abcdefghijklmno
supabase link --project-ref "$SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF"

# Review migration status (local vs remote)
supabase migration list

# Push pending migrations to remote
supabase db push

# Sanity-check realtime publication contains profile tables
supabase db remote commit "check-publication" --dry-run >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

If you previously applied migrations manually and encounter a history mismatch, prefer aligning by removing duplicate/manual changes and pushing via CLI. As a last resort, consult Supabase docs on repairing migration history.

#### Quick Smoke Test: Realtime Profile
1. Set `.env.local` with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for the target project.
2. Run `npm run dev` and sign in in two different browsers (or a window + incognito).
3. On the Profile page, add a new Experience. The second session should update within a second without a refresh.
4. Update the same entry’s title; both sessions should reflect the change immediately.

### Edge Functions in this repo
Located under `supabase/functions`:

- `apply-to-jobs` — orchestrates job application automations and enrichment
- `get-run` — polls Skyvern run status (screenshots, recording URL, parsed outputs)
- `get-jobs` — lightweight read endpoint for recent job listings
- `jobs-cron` — scheduled ingestion from job sources; supports deep research
- `process-and-match` — live search/extraction pipeline with multi-source parsing
- `skyvern-webhook` — webhook handler for async callbacks

Function environment variables live in `supabase/functions/.env.example`. Set these in Supabase → Project Settings → Functions → Environment Variables:

- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (required for DB writes)
- `JOB_SOURCES` (JSON): controls ingestion sources; examples in `docs/job-sources.md`
- `JOBS_CRON_EXPR` (cron): schedule for `jobs-cron`
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` (optional; enables deep research)
- `INCLUDE_LINKEDIN`, `INCLUDE_SEARCH` (booleans; control LinkedIn/search parsing)

### Agent Mode Access Model

The AI Assistant has two intended operating modes:

- **Ask mode**: general chat, guidance, and lightweight AI help without broad account retrieval.
- **Agent mode**: authenticated, tool-using assistance that can load the current user's account context and execute allowlisted Supabase functions on the user's behalf.

For Agent mode, the intended backend contract is:

- Load the signed-in user's data across all user-owned tables and artifacts, including profile fields, resumes, parsed resume data, jobs, applications, credits, subscription state, settings, and interview history.
- Pass the user's Supabase JWT when invoking Edge Functions so function calls execute as that user and continue to respect RLS and subscription enforcement.
- Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-side only. The model/browser should never receive raw service-role credentials.
- Expose an allowlisted function-calling surface for user-facing workflows such as job intake, evaluation, resume parsing, cover-letter generation, resume tailoring, interview prep, and automation triggers.
- Treat cross-user or admin-wide reads as a separate admin capability. They must not be part of default Agent mode for normal users.

This means the assistant should be able to answer questions like "Which jobs do I have in my profile?" by retrieving the authenticated user's records directly, instead of asking the user to paste them into chat.

### Gmail Integration

This project uses a Gmail MCP server to connect to your Gmail account. To set it up:

1.  **Initialize the submodule:**
    ```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend/gmail_mcp_server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Google Cloud credentials:**
    - Follow the instructions in the `backend/gmail_mcp_server/README.md` file to get your `gcp-oauth.keys.json` file.
    - Place the `gcp-oauth.keys.json` file in the `backend/gmail_mcp_server` directory.

4.  **Authorize the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run mcp:gmail -- auth
    ```

### Backend Functions Configuration

In addition to the frontend application, this project includes backend services using Supabase Edge Functions (e.g., for cron jobs that fetch job listings). These functions have their own environment variables.

A separate example file is provided at `supabase/functions/.env.example`. To configure the backend, you should copy this file to `.env` within the same directory (`supabase/functions/.env`) and set the variables. These variables must also be set in your Supabase project's settings under "Edge Functions".

```bash
# Navigate to the functions directory
cd supabase/functions

# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file will contain variables such as:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` (optional, for enhanced job searching)
- `JOBS_CRON_EXPR` (optional, for scheduling jobs)

See the `.env.example` file for a full list and detailed comments.

### CAPTCHA Protection (Cloudflare Turnstile)

JobRaker's auth screen forwards a Turnstile token to Supabase for email/password sign up, email/password sign in, password reset requests, and OAuth entrypoints from the auth screen.

To enable it end to end:

1. Create a Cloudflare Turnstile widget and allow:
   - `jobraker-tau.vercel.app`
   - `localhost`
   - `127.0.0.1`
2. In Supabase Dashboard, go to Authentication -> Bot and Abuse Protection, enable CAPTCHA protection, choose Turnstile, and paste the Turnstile secret key.
3. Set `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` in your local `.env` files and in Vercel project environment variables.
4. Rebuild and redeploy the frontend after changing the site key.

### Supabase Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**:
   - Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Note your project URL and anon key

2. **Configure Authentication Providers**:
   ```sql
   -- Enable email authentication
   SELECT auth.enable_email_auth();
   
   -- Configure OAuth providers (optional)
   -- Google, LinkedIn, GitHub
   ```

3. **Set up Database Schema**:
  Schema and migrations are generated directly via the Supabase CLI.

  - Author your schema in `backend/supabase/schema.sql`, or create tables in the local DB and diff.
  - Use these scripts from the repo root:

  ```bash
  # start local stack
  npm run supabase:start

  # reset local db (drops & re-applies migrations + seed)
  npm run supabase:reset

  # generate a migration from current DB state vs schema paths (adds a timestamped file under migrations/)
  npm run supabase:diff

  # dump the public schema into schema.sql (single source of truth for config.toml)
  npm run supabase:schema:dump

  # one-shot: generate migration (if any) and dump schema
  npm run supabase:schema:sync
  ```

   Notes:
  - The CLI is configured to read `schema_paths = ["./schema.sql"]` in `backend/supabase/config.toml`.
  - The seed file is at `backend/supabase/seed.sql` and runs on `db reset`.
   - Auth redirects and email template (confirmation) are configured for local dev in `backend/supabase/config.toml`:
     - `site_url` and `additional_redirect_urls` include `https://jobraker-tau.vercel.app`
     - Custom confirmation email template at `backend/supabase/templates/confirm.html`
   - In production, set these in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration and Email Templates.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

The project includes a comprehensive Tailwind configuration with:

- **Custom Color Palette**: Professional dark theme with green accents
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, typography, and shadows

ble via migration SQL
npm run db:create-bookmarks     # Create bookmarks via idempotent SQL
npm run db:create-core          # Create core tables (job listings + bookmarks)
```
```

### Environment notes for Vite
Development reads `VITE_`-prefixed variables from `.env.*` files. For production builds, `vite.config.ts` injects only two variables at build time:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Ensure these are defined in your deployment environment (e.g., Vercel) before building.

### Component Architecture

#### Design System

The application follows a strict design system built on:

- **Atomic Design**: Components organized by complexity (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **Composition Pattern**: Flexible component composition over inheritance
- **Props Interface**: Strongly typed component APIs
- **Theme System**: Consistent design tokens throughout the application

#### State Management

- **Local State**: React useState and useReducer for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Context API for application-wide state
- **Server State**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for backend data
- **URL State**: React Router for navigation and deep linking

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Leverage type inference where appropriate
- Use generic types for reusable components

#### React Best Practices
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Memoization for performance optimization

#### Styling Guidelines
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Component-scoped styles when necessary
- Consistent spacing using design tokens
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Performance Optimization

#### Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting at route level
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Image optimization with next-gen formats

#### Runtime Performance
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Lazy loading for images and components

#### Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Error boundary implementation
- Performance profiling with React DevTools
- Bundle analyzer for size monitoring

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Installation Problems**:
   ```bash
   # Clear npm cache
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # Delete node_modules and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build Failures**:
   ```bash
   # Check Node.js version
   node --version  # Should be 18+
   
   # Clear build cache
   rm -rf dist
   npm run build
   ```
   - **Syntax Errors**: Errors like `Unexpected end of file before a closing "div" tag` indicate a syntax error in a component. Check the specified file for missing closing tags.

3.  **Development Server Crashes**:
    - **Identifier has already been declared**: This error occurs when the same name is imported from multiple libraries in the same file (e.g., `import { Link } from 'lucide-react'` and `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'`). Resolve this by removing or renaming one of the imports.

4. **Supabase Connection Issues**:
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check Supabase project status
   - Ensure API keys are correct

#### Performance Issues

- **Slow Loading**: Check network tab for large bundles
- **Memory Leaks**: Use React DevTools Profiler
- **Animation Lag**: Reduce motion for low-end devices
